This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/irrlicht-minetest so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there. My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.

This is the fork of irrlicht for the development version of minetest, FreeBSD users should already have https://github.com/tigersharke/minetest-dev for a complete build.
