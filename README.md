This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/irrlicht-minetest so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there.

This is the fork of irrlicht for the development version of minetest, FreeBSD users should already have https://github.com/tigersharke/minetest-dev for a complete build.
